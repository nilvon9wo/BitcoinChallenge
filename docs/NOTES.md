1. In order to make a page which can be displayed on the Salesforce Platform, 
I developed a "Community" on a "Scratch Org".  At the time of this writing,
the page for this community can be found at:

https://sandbox-bitcoin-challenge-developer-edition.cs82.force.com/price/s/

(As this is a scratch org, this page may no longer exist.)
