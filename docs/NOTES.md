1. In order to make a page which can be displayed on the Salesforce Platform, 
I developed a "Community" on a "Scratch Org".  At the time of this writing,
the page for this community can be found at:

https://sandbox-bitcoin-challenge-developer-edition.cs82.force.com/price/s/

(As this is a scratch org, this page may no longer exist.)

2. As the challenge does not specify anything related to Salesforce,
I've chosen to minimalize Salesforce's involvement to just hosting the solution.
The visitor's web-browser will be responsible for fetching data from the API.
